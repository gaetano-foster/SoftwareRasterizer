# SoftwareRasterizer_PGE

## Description

It is a basic program that can load and render 3D Objects.
It took a lot of time and effort, but ultimately it is a port of [Javidx9's 3D renderer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU), and therefore it is not all my code. However, I used this project as a learning experience, and I did learn a lot about 3D mathematics and rendering. On top of that, this project helped me learn C++.

## Demonstration

// TODO: Make a demonstration

I wrote this back when I was using Linux, and I don't care to try and move the project to visual studio to compile it and run it. You just gotta trust that it works as intended 🙏🙏.
